      <p class="paragraph-5">We understand that dealing with vehicle damage and insurance claims can feel overwhelming. Our team is here to guide you through the process, ensuring your vehicle is repaired to the highest standards with clear communication every step of the way.<br><br>You Have the Right to Choose Your Repair Shop:<br>Insurance companies may recommend specific body shops, but you always have the right to choose where your vehicle is repaired. At Ernest Henry Auto Body, we work with all major insurance providers and always put our customers first. Whether or not we are part of your insurer’s preferred network, we are committed to delivering safe, high-quality repairs that meet or exceed manufacturer standards. At Ernest Henry Auto Body, we work for you, not your insurance company. Your trust and your vehicle’s safety are our top priorities.<br>‍<br>Our Estimate and Approval Process:<br>When you bring your vehicle to us, we provide a precise repair estimate. Your insurance company may also prepare their own estimate, but if additional damage is found after disassembly, we handle the communication and approval process directly with your insurance adjuster. Our goal is to keep the repair process moving smoothly while making sure no damage is overlooked. We are fully transparent about the work your vehicle needs and keep you updated throughout the entire process.<br>‍<br>Understanding Parts Used in Your Repair:<br>There are generally three types of parts that may be used in your repair:<br><br>OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Parts: Genuine parts made by your vehicle’s manufacturer, ensuring the best fit and quality.<br><br>Aftermarket Parts: Parts made by third-party manufacturers, which may vary in quality and cost.<br><br>Recycled Parts: Quality used parts sourced from other vehicles, often used to help manage repair costs within insurance guidelines.<br><br>At Ernest Henry Auto Body, we always review your options with you and prioritize your vehicle’s safety and appearance. If you prefer OEM parts, we will help you determine if your insurance covers them or discuss out-of-pocket options.<br><br>Deductibles and Payment:<br>If your insurance policy includes a deductible, you will be responsible for paying it directly to Ernest Henry Auto Body when you pick up your vehicle. We will always clearly explain any out-of-pocket costs before repairs begin to ensure there are no surprises.<br><br>Rental Vehicle Assistance:<br>Review your insurance policy to determine if it includes rental reimbursement. If so, your insurer will typically cover the cost of a rental vehicle while your car is being repaired, within the limits of your policy.<br><br>Handling Supplemental Damage:<br>It’s common for additional damage to be discovered after disassembly. When this happens, we submit supplemental documentation to your insurance company right away and wait for authorization before proceeding. Our priority is to ensure that your vehicle is fully repaired, with no corners cut.<br><br>Understanding Total Loss Situations:<br>If the cost to repair your vehicle exceeds a certain percentage of its market value, your insurance company may declare it a total loss. If this happens, Ernest Henry Auto Body will guide you through the process, answer your questions, and help you navigate your settlement options.</p>
